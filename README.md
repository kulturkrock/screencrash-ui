## Dependencies
The primary dependency for this repository is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) which needs to be installed and accessible.

In particular, whatever editor or command line you wish to use needs to be able to run `npm`, which will manage the code and development dependencies.

An optional dependency on GNU Make exists, in that a simple `Makefile` is provided, but the commands all delegate to `npm` (see next section).



## Setup and Commands

The following commands are available, and should be run from the repository root folder (same folder as the `Makefile` and `package.json`).

When using `make`, installing of dependencies will be done automatically and `make init` should not need to be run manually. However, when only using `npm` then `npm install` must be run first in order to install the dependencies for the other commands.

| Using `make` | Using `npm` |   |
|--------------|-------------|---|
| `make` | | Running make without arguments is equivalent to `make build` |
| `make init` | `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `make build` | `npm run build` | Build the project |
| `make watch` | `npm run watch` | Build, and then watch for changes in the source and rebuild as needed |
| `make serve` | `npm run serve` | Start a [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/) server and open a new browser tab or window to it using the system's default web browser |
| `make dev` | `npm run dev` | Run `make watch` and `make serve` in parallel, providing automatic rebuild on changes and automatic reload in the browser |

The easiest way to get started should be to run `make dev`, which will 
 1. install dependencies,
 2. build the project,
 3. start a server for the project,
 4. open a web browser to the project,
 5. and rebuild and reload as needed when editing source files.



## Files and Folders

| Path |   |
|------|---|
| `README.md` | This file. Hi!
| `LICENSE` | License text.
| `Makefile` | Makefile, containing the commands described above.
| `package.json` | Node.js package file, describing the `npm` commands above and all dependencies.
| `tsconfig.json` | TypeScript configuration for the project.
| `webpack.config.js` | Configuration for `webpack` that describes how to build the project.
| `browser-sync.config.js` | Configuration for `browser-sync` which describes how to serve the project.
|
| `src/` | Source code, compiled by `webpack` using the build commands described above.
| `src/tsx/main.tsx` | The main entry point of the project.
| `dist/` | "Distribution," i.e., where the project is built to and served from. This contains static files (in particular, `index.html`) that are not managed by `webpack`.
|
| `dist/webpack/` | Where `webpack` is configured to put all compilation output, and is ignored by `git`. Deleting this folder is equivalent to cleaning the build.
| `node_modules` | Where `npm` puts dependencies it installs, and is ignored by `git`.
